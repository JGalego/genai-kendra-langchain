## [GenAI applications on enterprise data with Amazon Kendra, LangChain and LLMs](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/quickly-build-high-accuracy-generative-ai-applications-on-enterprise-data-using-amazon-kendra-langchain-and-large-language-models/)

In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to implement [Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401) (RAG) workflows for generative AI (GenAI) applications with [Amazon Kendra](https://aws.amazon.com/kendra/), [🦜️🔗 LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/index.html) and state-of-the-art [Large Language Models](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/introduction-to-large-language-models) (LLM) to provide a conversational experience backed by data.

> Visit [Generative AI on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/generative-ai/) for the latest news on GenAI and learn how AWS is helping reinvent customer experiences and applications.
